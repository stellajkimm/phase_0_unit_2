# Ruby Algorithms
This week you will be working on algorithms and basic testing in Ruby. Please make sure to follow each step we ask you to do (write driver test code, pseudocode, initial solution, refactoring, reflection, and review). 



## Challenges
1. [Create Accountability Groups](1_create_accountability_groups.md)
2. [Homework Cheater](2_homework_cheater.md)
3. [Separate Numbers with Commas SOLO CHALLENGE](3_nums_commas_solo_challenge.md)
4. [Group Cipher Challenge](4_group_cipher_challenge.md)
5. [Reverse Cipher Challenge](5_reverse_cipher.md)
6. [Technical Blog](6_technical_blog.md)
7. [Cultural Blog](7_cultural_blog.md)


## Submitting your work
You should fork the unit 2 repo into your GitHub Account by clicking the "fork" button on the top right of this page. You will be responsible for syncing changes in the unit 2 repo by following the steps [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11394349/upstream-pulls-with-the-github-desktop-client). Make sure you follow them step by step. 

If you look in the [solutions](./my_solutions/) folder, you will see we've provided a template for you. You will want to make new files and use this template for submitting any challenge without a pre-existing file. 

When you make updates to the files (or add a file), you should commit your work the same way you did for your website through the app. Include a commit message that describes what you've changed.

You need to submit your work through [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Tjg3YO2Nb_JSvauKIdr2vXcRvZ074yrVQhXxjg81sLc/viewform) by Sunday at 11:59pm. Expect to submit the links from your repo for each challenge above.
